# SillyTavern Character Similarity

This extension finds similar characters in your library using text embeddings from a KoboldCpp API.

## Installation

Install using SillyTavern's built-in extension installer.

## Usage

1.  Click the new "Find Similar Characters" button (it looks like a network diagram) located in the top bar of the character management screen, next to the search bar.
2.  (Optional) The extension settings can be configured in the main Extensions settings panel (plug icon). Ensure the "KoboldCpp URL" points to the base URL of your running KoboldCpp instance (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5001`).

Future updates will add the main functionality.
